University Network Design


Project Overview
This project involves designing a secure and efficient network infrastructure for a university, covering two main locations and a dedicated server area. The design ensures high connectivity, robust security, and seamless communication across all departments.

Features
Network Segmentation:
Divided into multiple VLANs for improved security and traffic management.

Security Implementations:

Port Security to restrict unauthorized devices.
Disabled unused ports to prevent potential threats.
ARP Snooping and DHCP Snooping to prevent spoofing attacks.
DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) to isolate and protect public-facing services.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) for fine-grained traffic filtering.
PortFast and BPDU Guard to optimize and protect Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) operations.
Site-to-Site VPN to secure communication between the two locations.
Connectivity Configurations:

Dynamic IP allocation via DHCP.
OSPF routing for efficient and scalable inter-network communication.
High Availability and Redundancy:

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) in Rapid PVST mode to prevent network loops.
HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) for backup and failover support.

Equipment and Tools
Switches: Cisco 2960 (or equivalent)
Routers: Cisco 1941 (or equivalent)
Firewalls: (Specify if used)
Simulation Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3
Implementation Details
Network Segmentation:
Configured VLANs to separate traffic for different departments.

Security Configurations:
Applied port security, ACLs, DMZ, and VPN for enhanced protection.

Routing and Connectivity:
Used OSPF for dynamic routing and DHCP for automatic IP assignment.

High Availability:
Configured HSRP for backup and failover capabilities.

Spanning Tree Protocol:
Enabled Rapid PVST to optimize network stability and prevent loops.

Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Managing VLAN configurations across multiple switches.

Solution: Utilized VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) to simplify VLAN management.
Challenge 2: Preventing loops in a complex topology.

Solution: Implemented Rapid PVST and BPDU Guard.
How to Run the Simulation
Open the provided .pkt or .gns3 file in Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.
Follow the included configuration files and testing instructions to explore the network.

Conclusion
This network design successfully achieves secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity for the university. Future improvements may include integrating wireless networks and exploring software-defined networking (SDN) for further optimization.
